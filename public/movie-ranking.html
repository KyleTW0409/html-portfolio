<h2>Top 3 movies...</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Number 1: Spider-man: Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
<p>Went into the theatre not really having any expectations and came out legitimately dumbfounded by how good it was.</p>

<h3>Number 2: Avengers Infinity War</h3>
<p>An epochal film, one that I can legitimately watch over and over again with sheer enjoyment.</p>

<h3>Number 3: Perks of being a wallflower</h3>
<p>A touching film with endearing characters that makes you want to live life to the fullest.</p>
